Near by App:
        An app that takes user location and category preference (optionally) and gives out a list of Activities
        he/she can perform around that location.



        Expected features:
        Local caching - activies fected during last session (irrespective of location and preference changes) are showed before network call for the currrent session is successful

        UI is updated once we get actual network response and the new response is cached

        We fetch only 10 activities at once from API and paginate when we user scrolls more

        User is able to sort activities by distance, time required to complete activity, rating etc

        Also, there is a fancy feature, show random activity. On click of which a random activity is shown to the user and the activity once shown is not repeated and if we exhaust all the activites, a message is shown saying all activies are exhausted (additionally can implement pagination logic here as well, to try fetching next page after all the activities currently fetched are exhausted)



        Note:
        Mostly intereted in the contracts between the differeny layers and not the functional/business logic of different blocks.
        UI is implemneted by a separate team member. You need to focus on exposing the clean API for UI to consume.
        Solution is expected to be of Production Quality (Modular, extendable and testable) and in a large team setup
        Additional points if the solution given is extendable for possible future usecases
